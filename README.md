Rinkudesu is (well... will eventually be) a web application for managing links.

For now there's... not much here, but the project is just starting.
I hope it's not gonna end up in a Graveyard of Side Projects and actually end up as a fully working and usable application.

More information about the project will appear here as the project (slowly) grows.
